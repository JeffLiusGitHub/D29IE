Children under the age of 12 can ride on footpaths, bike paths, shared paths and separated footpaths (see Separated footpaths on page 27). If you are an adult (18 years or older) supervising a child under 12 you can ride with them on a footpath.</span></p><h1 class="c11" id="h.1glizlm3n6b6"><span class="c2">Child seats </span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your child can be a passenger on your bike if you have fitted a properly designed child seat. Unless the bike is parked, your child must remain in the child seat. Make sure you get a safe child seat. For further information, call the Safety Centre at The Royal Children&rsquo;s Hospital on (03) 9345 5085. </span></p><h1 class="c11" id="h.jq25dtwdhp72"><span class="c2">Trailers and cargo bikes</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c17">&nbsp;Trailers</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;To take a child in a trailer towed behind a bike you must be at least 16 years old and the child must be under 10 years old, unless they are carrying a medical certificate for a disability or medical condition. The trailer must also be able to safely carry the passenger. You must not use a trailer on a footpath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;It is a good idea to attach a flag to the trailer so it can be seen more easily. If you&rsquo;re riding at night or in bad weather, you must attach lights and a reflector to your bike (see page 4 for details). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s also a good idea to attach:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&bull; red lights and reflectors to the back of the trailer, and </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&bull; yellow reflectors to each side of the trailer.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c17">Cargo bikes </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Cargo bikes&rsquo; have a box or other carrier which is part of the front of the bike.

Minor traffic offences, such as failing to give a hand signal when you have to, are often called traffic &lsquo;infringements&rsquo;. They will usually be dealt with by an on-the-spot fine. For more serious offences, such as riding dangerously, you could be convicted of a crime and go to prison.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c17">Traffic infringements </span></p><p class="c1"><span>If you commit a traffic infringement you will be given an &lsquo;infringement notice&rsquo; by a police officer. The notice lists the road rule you broke, the amount of the on-the-spot fine, the due date for payment and how to pay.

But if you decide not to pay the fine straight away, you can ask for it to be reviewed by the body that issued it or challenge it in court. If you&rsquo;re going to court, get legal advice first. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c20">More serious traffic offences</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like a motorist, you can be charged with more serious traffic offences. If convicted of these offences you can get a large fine or even a prison term. Here are two examples. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Careless riding</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You must not ride your bike carelessly on a road. For example, riding too fast for the conditions and not looking where you are going could amount to careless riding. If you are convicted of careless riding you could receive a substantial fine. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dangerous riding</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;You must not risk public safety by riding your bike dangerously. For example, riding too fast for the conditions and not looking out for pedestrians could amount to dangerous riding. If you are convicted of dangerous riding, you could receive a large fine or even a prison term.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c11" id="h.tdwix8kq1r2t"><span class="c2">Being stopped by police</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;If you are riding your bike and are stopped by police for questioning regarding an offence, you must give the police your correct name and address. It is a criminal offence not to give it, or to give a false name or address. You are not required to say anything else, even if you are arrested. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have the right to ask a police officer for their name, rank and the police station they are from. If asked, the police must give you those details.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;If the police arrest you, they must tell you why. If you are arrested, you must go with the police, usually to a police station. You do not have to say anything, and you have the right to call a relative or friend (to tell them where you are), as well as a lawyer</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c11" id="h.wlcrvi7b7acw"><span class="c2">Crashes</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;If you are involved in a crash with another rider, pedestrian or driver, you have certain responsibilities and rights. If you are in a crash in which someone is hurt, you must:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&bull; stop and help them </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&bull; give your name and address to anyone involved, and to any police present</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&bull; report the crash to the police.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;It is a serious offence if you do not.

It also covers you if you crash into an open or opening car door, or if you collide with a stationary vehicle while you are riding to or from work. To be eligible, you must report the crash to police. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c17">What the TAC does not cover</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The TAC scheme does not cover crashes that only involved you and another bike rider or a pedestrian, or you alone. Note, also, that the TAC will not cover you when you can be compensated under another scheme, such as WorkSafe.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c17">What you can get</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under the TAC scheme, you can get the cost of reasonable medical expenses covered, as well as compensation for lost earnings from your job while you recover. If you were seriously injured in a crash that was the fault of a motorist or train or tram driver, you can also sue for compensation (&lsquo;damages&rsquo;). Call the TAC on 1300 654 329 or visit their website (www.tac.vic.gov.au) for more information on making a claim. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c12 c17"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
